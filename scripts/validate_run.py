Schema validation is only half of it. The rest is the part a schema cannot
express: that the profile and suite are declared, that `cpu_sets` lines up with
`threads`, and that the recorded commit actually exists in the checkout it
names — a manifest that points at a commit nobody can resolve is not evidence.
