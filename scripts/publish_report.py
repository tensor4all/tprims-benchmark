"""Publish one recorded run as the cell's report, then regenerate the index.

This is the only place the publish rule lives, so `record_run.py` and a manual
re-publish after a report-format change cannot disagree:

* a run that did not cover the suite's declared spec never displaces the
  published report;
* the published file is a copy of the run's own report, so the report and the
  raw data it came from cannot drift apart.
